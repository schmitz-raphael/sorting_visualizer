# Sorting Visualizer

A Next.js app showcasing animated visualizations of various sorting algorithms.
## Description

This project is a modern web app built with Next.js (bootstrapped using create-next-app), featuring animated, interactive visualizations of sorting algorithms. It's written in TypeScript and leverages dynamic user interaction and smooth animations.
Features

Visual representations of popular sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)

Responsive and interactive UI built with modern web technologies

Real-time visualization of the algorithmâ€™s operations

Polished styling using Next.js with optimized loading of the Geist font
